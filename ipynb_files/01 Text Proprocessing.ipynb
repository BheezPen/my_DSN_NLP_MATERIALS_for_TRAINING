    "Explanation:\n",
    "------------\n",
    "- `stopwords.words('english')` loads a predefined list of common English stopwords.\n",
    "- `set(stopwords.words('english'))` converts the list into a set for **faster lookup**.\n",
    "- Example stopwords: {\"the\", \"is\", \"in\", \"at\", \"which\", \"and\", \"but\", \"or\", \"a\", \"an\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a set?\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "- Checking if a word is in a **set** is faster (O(1) time complexity) compared to a **list** (O(n)).\n",
    "- This makes the stopword removal process much **more efficient** for large datasets.\n",

    "    - It takes a sentence, splits it into individual words, \n",
